# Kcasey's Quick Password Generator

## About
This is my first JavaScript project. This password generator will create a password of a custom length using lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. 

The password length box will allow a password length of 8 to 128 characters. *With the default being 12 characters.*

Each function regarding the selectable password criteria will run only if their respected check box is selected.
